# Time tracker

<b>STILL IN PROGRESS!</b>

## About

track time for individual tasks!

Uses json-server to host a server so a .json file
can be used as a "database".

## Features

- Create / delete / modify tasks
- Add tags for tasks
- Sort tasks based on tags
- Track time for individual tasks, even if the app is closed
- Settings screen, where you can toggle dark / light mode and alternative mode for tracking time (You can either track time for 1 task or multiple tasks at once)
